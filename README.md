# Murdery Mystery (jupyter notebook)
  Problem Statement:
    A fictional murder has been committed and a murder note left at the scene of the crime.
    Luckily, we have personal written statements from all three suspects, Lily, Gregg, and Myrtle.
    Let's solve the crime by writing a program that compares the language used in these notes!
    
  Solution Details:
    The program compares language using three sorts of comparison:
    1. Sentence length
    2. Word Choice
    3. 'Ngram' comparison (Definition and details can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram )
  
  
# Tome Rater, 
  Context:
    This project is a display of:
    1. Object orientated programming (manipulation of 5 classes, class inheritance, attributes)
    2. Basic syntax and iteration (The above cannot be accomplished without knowledge of lists, 
       loops, dictionaries, strings, and control flow)
       
  Problem Statement:
    "Tome Rater" is the name of a program that will act as a sort of library. Books and users can
    be added as objects with unique and shared attributes, books can be classified in terms of genre,
    and books can be added and rated by users.
    
    Details:
    1. The program is then imported to a populate file and manipulated there.
    2. The highest rating user(s), highest rated book(s), most read book(s), as well as a catalog of 
    users and books can be printed, as shown in the populate file.
